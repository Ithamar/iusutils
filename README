iusutils
========

These tools are used to handle .ius file, the firmware update format used by InfoTMIC devices. They
have only been tested under Linux (Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit) but should work fine under any UNIX, and
probably will work under Cygwin as well.

To build these tools, have the development package for libz installed, and either use "make" or
include the repository in your android manifest and run "mmm <dir>" to build from the Android
build system.

iusunpack
=========

Usage: iusunpack [-s] iusfile

This unpacks all components in an ius file. It will dump out .img/.bin files with the content
of the sub images (like bootkernel.img, system.img, u-boot-nand.bin, etc).

The -s switch will strip off any U-Boot header from the files extracted. This makes it easier to
e.g. unpack ramdisks and the like. Use the "file" utility on the extracted and stripped files to
find out what the format is (yaffs2 images get reported as VM Executables on Ubuntu at least).

iuspack
=======

Usage: iuspack [-o imagefile] [-m bmagic] [-v firmware-version] [part:file...]

This creates an ius file named "imagefile" for a specific target device. It includes the images
specified in part:file, in the same format as shown in the output of iusunpack. See below for a
list of possible values for "part".

"bmagic" can be gleened from /proc/cmdline on the device, and "firmware-version" is a 6 sequence
of 6 numbers seperated with dots, as follows:

[first number of swver].[first digit of hwver].[second digit of hwver].[third digit of hwversion].[second digit of swver].[third digit of swver]

where "hwver" is the "hwver" from /proc/cmdline on the device, and "swver" is simply a software
version.

NOTE: The hwversion and bmagic values are checked by the bootloader when updating, so these 
should match, or the update will not be applied!

The options for "part" are:
	U0:		Device specific first stage u-boot loader
	UBOOT:		U-Boot core
	RD:		Normal boot ramdisk
	RD_:		Recovery ramdisk
	LK:		Linux kernel
	NK:		?
	ADR_SYS:	Uncompressed system partition image
	ADR_USER:	Userdata partition image
	NDISK:		?
	ADR_AS:		GZip compressed system partition image

Easiest is to extract an existing .ius file for your device, and use the output of iusunpack
to build the commandline for iuspack. You can leave any parts out, the bootloader handles
updates of zero or more parts perfectly.

NOTE: I advice *not* to flash U0/UBOOT unless you know what you are doing! Normally all you
need is to flash RD/LK/ADR_SYS/ADR_AS only!

Hope this helps the community in the InfoTMIC hacking!
